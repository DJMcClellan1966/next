# Monetization Opportunities - What Could Make Money

## Your Competitive Advantages (Potential)

⚠️ **CURRENT STATUS:** These are **potential** advantages. Current implementation is a proof-of-concept with significant limitations for regulated industries.

**Potential Advantages:**
1. **Zero API Costs** - No per-query fees (huge for high-volume) ✅ *This is real*
2. **Complete Privacy** - All processing local (crucial for sensitive data) ⚠️ *Local but not HIPAA-compliant*
3. **Customizable** - Train on specific domains/data ⚠️ *Limited - needs domain-specific models*
4. **Offline Capable** - Works without internet ✅ *This is real*
5. **Own the Stack** - Full control, no vendor lock-in ✅ *This is real*

**Key Limitations:**
- ❌ Not HIPAA-compliant for healthcare (missing security/privacy features)
- ❌ No medical domain adaptation (needs PubMedBERT, SNOMED, ICD)
- ❌ Not clinically validated (unproven medical accuracy)
- ❌ Experimental methods (quantum kernels unproven for healthcare)
- ❌ Not production-ready (missing deployment, integration, safety)

**See `healthcare/LIMITATIONS.md` for detailed limitations.**
